Spectral unmixing of Indian_pines dataset with 2D CNN written in MATLAB by Morteza Safari

The preprocessing file converts the image to an array and extracts random spectra of 17 classes for training of algorithm. The postprocessing file is for converting back the Softmax output into the classified image.

Indian_pines_gt is the labled data used for training and validation.

Indian_pines_corrected is the hyperspectral dataset used in this project. This is a wellknown dataset for benchmarking.
